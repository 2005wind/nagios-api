NAME
----
nagios-api - presents a REST-like JSON interface to Nagios


SYNOPSIS
--------
*nagios-api* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This program provides a simple REST-like interface to Nagios. Run this
on your Nagios host and then sit back and enjoy a much easier, more
straightforward way to accomplish things with Nagios. You can use the
bundled nagios-cli, but you may find it easier to write your own system
for interfacing with the API.


USAGE
-----
Usage is pretty easy:

  nagios-api -p 8080 -c /var/lib/nagios3/rw/nagios.cmd \
             -s /var/cache/nagios3/status.dat -l /var/log/nagios3/nagios.log

You must at least provide the status file options. If you don't provide
the other options, then we will disable that functionality and error to
clients who request it.


OPTIONS
-------
*-p, --port*='PORT'::
    Listen on port 'PORT' for HTTP requests.

*-c, --command-file*='FILE'::
    Use 'FILE' to write commands to Nagios. This is where external
    commands are sent. If your Nagios installation does not allow
    external commands, do not set this option.

*-s, --status-file*='FILE'::
    Set 'FILE' to the status file where Nagios stores its status
    information. This is where we learn about the state of the world and
    is the only required parameter.

*-l, --log-file*='FILE'::
    Point 'FILE' to the location of Nagios's log file if you want to
    allow people to subscribe to it.


API
---
TODO: document the API.
